Welcome to our Github repository! This app is built with Next.js, Tailwind.css, pnpm, Prisma, and Supabase.

## Running the app

### Testing database

To run the app with testing database, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisities

-   [Volta](https://volta.sh/) - we use Volta, install guide [here](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started), **it handles Node.js and pnpm versions**.
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - please install it with Volta, we always use latest version.
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - please follow [this guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) to install pnpm (**it is different from npm shipped with Node.js**), optionally you can use Volta, but pnpm support is [experimental](https://docs.volta.sh/advanced/pnpm).

#### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
1. Create the environment variables in a `.env` file in the root directory. You can find an example in `.env.testing` file in the root directory, it has almost all variables except SendGrid, so emails won't work locally. To get the key download `.env` file from [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/093He0QT) with password `BpYwfi4ngg`.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
1. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
